# UX Agents for Product, Design & Research Teams

Welcome to my personal collection and research into building **UX agents** designed to supercharge the workflows of product managers, designers of different flavors, and researchers.

These agents aim to improve efficiency across the entire product development lifecycle from discovery to delivery by embedding contextual intelligence, speeding up repetitive tasks, and enabling faster decision-making.

## What's Inside

This repository contains:

- Experiments with UX agents focused on:
  - Design audits  
  - Research synthesis  
  - PM spec analysis  
  - UI/UX pattern suggestions  
  - Competitive analysis  
  - Meeting summaries & decision logging  
- Early prototypes and prompt systems inspired by tools like Devin, Cursor, Replit Agent, and others—but reimagined for product, design, and research workflows.
- Collected prompt engineering techniques, interaction patterns, and tooling strategies for UX-specific AI agents.

---

## Current Focus Areas

- Building context-aware agents that plug into VS code
- Making spec generators and decision history agents
- Automating research tasks like tagging, clustering, and insight surfacing
- Reducing meetings through async decision and prompt-driven summaries

---

## Roadmap

No roadmap right now but expect future updates on:
- Support for multi-agent collaboration
- Context persistence and user memory
- Domain-specific agents

---

## Why This Matters

Modern product teams are overwhelmed by coordination, documentation, and repetition. These agents are my attempt to:

- Make product & design work feel less like admin
- Help teams get to better decisions, faster
- Unlock creative and strategic energy from time-draining processes

If you're building tools for product teams—or *are* part of one—I’d love your feedback and thoughts.
